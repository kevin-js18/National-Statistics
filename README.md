# National-Statistics
An analysis of US national statistics for the last 10 years, through visualization. 

All visualizations are split into 5 categories:

* Economy
* Election (only 2008 and 2012)
* Energy/Environment
* Immigration

The actual visualizations are image files that can be found by going to the "Charts" folder and then selecting one of the categories above. 

The corresponding code for each of the visualizations can be found by going to the "Scripts" folder, going to the same category folder, and then selecting the .R file that has the same filename as its corresponding visualization. 
**Descriptions of visualizations can be found inside the code.**
